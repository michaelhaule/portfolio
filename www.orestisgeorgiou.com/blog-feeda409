Not only that, but scientific opinions and advice have often been downplayed as unpopular or unrealistic and have thus been ignored. The risk of prioritizing misinformation or populism over scientific advice is highly dangerous.</p>&nbsp;

&nbsp;<p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><blockquote><p class="">It's only a model</p></blockquote><p class="">Some complain that "models are just models". Well, there is this model that predicts that if you jump through the window you will be attracted by the ground with a force inversely proportional to the height of your floor. Would you ignore Gravity and jump? It's just a model. Hopefully not.</p><blockquote><p class="">You have to be knocking on an open door if they are to listen</p></blockquote><p class="">COVID-19 may open this door. More scientific advisors will sit on management boards, be invited on public talk shows, and be consulted by governments. This is all good news! It's good for scientists whose research and inquisitive brains will be put to good use. It's good for businesses who are now scrambling to deal with the new post-COVID norm. It's good for the economy as governments will take a science-backed approach when introducing new measures in mitigating the imminent COVID-19 recession. It's good for the consumer who in the past few weeks has been panic-buying toilet rolls and pasta. And it's good for society as we recover from social distancing and the loss of loved ones.</p><blockquote><p class="">The rise of the Scientific Advisor</p></blockquote><p class="">Science communication has never been as important and as popular. So here are a few fundamental and simple tips:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Don't dumb it down</p></li><li><p class="">Don't generalize</p></li><li><p class="">Don't use aggressive language</p></li></ol><p class="">All the above decrease trustworthiness and credibility</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Establish yourself as an expert</p></li><li><p class="">Start with Why?

&nbsp;<p class="">Sadly, these after-effects will disproportionately hit low-income and minority workers in poor and rich countries alike. This means that policymakers will need to make sure that, as countries open up, the recovery doesn’t make inequality even worse than it already is. Scientists can help with that.

For this to happen, policymakers and scientists must work closer together.</p><p class=""><span>Here are some of my current thoughts and suggestions</span>.&nbsp;<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p class=""><strong><em>“If one had told me that in two weeks, we would have created 500 new ICU beds or completely reorganized our hospital system, I would have said, okay, you are crazy, and it's happening now”</em></strong>&nbsp;is what Dr Giacomo Grasselli said a few days ago (see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mrPHO-nkVE" target="_blank">video</a>) about the Italian’s response to the Covid-19 outbreak in Lombardy.</p><p class="">One can only but imagine Giacomo’s unfortunate realization that a wealthy region like Lombardy would be struck by this virus so hard and that drastic measures and actions were needed.</p><blockquote><p class=""><strong>Are we prepared?</strong></p></blockquote><p class="">Public health policy decisions during a potential crisis are difficult as they must balance a zoo of scientific, budgetary, social, and political considerations. In an ideal world, each of these elements should have been considered well in advance and in a transparent fashion before reaching a decision or implementing a specific policy. In practice however, the reaction to the Covid-19 outbreak has to date been one of cautionary prevention. Almost all affected countries have announced measures that restrict travel and impose social distancing; a strategy that will almost surely have a strong social and economic impact as they disrupt people’s lives and business, but that will also minimise the number of fatalities and&nbsp;<em>flatten the curve</em>&nbsp;thus not overwhelming their already stretched healthcare resources while slowly but steadily building up herd immunity.</p><blockquote><p class=""><strong>What's our strategy?</strong></p></blockquote><p class="">Already, officials all over the world like Dr Grasselli are faced with evermore difficult situations and questions. For example, can contact tracing and testing translate into population-level virus containment effects, and if so, would its scale-up have sufficient impact to justify the added cost? Is screening individuals at airports an effective method of infection control? (btw it wasn’t for the H1N1 pandemic). Can we evaluate the expected epidemiological and economic impact of different strategies for scaling up Covid-19 screening and testing (e.g., centralized, at airports, or at individual clinics), and can we estimate the required ICU bed capacity in each country/region given the observed reproduction number (R0), incubation and recovery time of the virus?</p><p class="">Such questions can be, and have been, addressed effectively using mathematical modeling methods that connect dynamic SEIR (susceptible - exposed - infected - recovered) models to specific intervention strategies and their socio-economic costs and benefits. See for example some early results by Hellewell, Kucharski and Cowling et al (2020).</p><blockquote><p class=""><strong>A case for mathematical models.</strong></p></blockquote><p class="">Unfortunately, such mathematical modelling methods are rarely constructed in some parts of the world because they are perceived to be “too complex”, “too dependent on assumptions”, and “not accurate enough”. These misconceptions stem mostly from a tradition of insufficient communication between public health officials and expert scientists in academic environments.</p><blockquote><p class=""><strong>It’s a trust and science communication problem.</strong></p></blockquote><p class="">As a scientist myself, I am personally compelled to passionately promote quantitative, data-driven and systematic methods that can help us take the right sequence of public health policy decisions. How else can one evaluate&nbsp;<em>a priori</em>&nbsp;the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of possible interventions at a population level? How else will we make the right choices and avoid taking unnecessary and ineffective actions?</p><p class="">Through my experience in modelling complex systems (see my publications&nbsp;<a href="https://www.orestisgeorgiou.com/publications" target="_blank">page</a>), there rarely exists a one-size-fits-all solution. Each country should thus develop or adapt mathematical models to fit their own requirements, circumstances, and peculiarities. Understanding the effectiveness of control measures in different settings is paramount for understanding the dynamics of the outbreak, and the likelihood that transmission can eventually be contained or effectively mitigated. Moreover, once a model is constructed, it can iteratively incorporate updated data, leading to better estimates and highlighting existing weaknesses in the model assumptions and in the available data so that it may also be used during the next epidemic/pandemic outbreak.</p><blockquote><p class=""><strong>OK, but how?</strong></p></blockquote><p class="">For mathematical models to be useful for decision makers, they must be both relevant and methodologically sound. According to Knight et al. (2016) developing a useful model requires one to identify:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">a set of useful questions and their epidemiological contexts,</p></li><li><p class="">a framework through which these questions can be addressed,</p></li><li><p class="">the parameters required to address the specified questions,</p></li><li><p class="">the empirical evidence available to inform those parameters.</p></li></ol><p class="">Each of these 4 steps necessitates early engagement and transparent communication from local, national, and/or international policymakers themselves. They are the ones who should inform scientists and academics of the key public health questions to be considered. They are also the ones who can provide access to accurate data and lay out all possible public instruments, measures, and resources available as ingredients to the intervention.</p><p class="">Similarly, the modelers should guide those with less methodological expertise and explain their results and mathematical insights in a transparent and accessible manner so not to be perceived as a ‘black box’ that is susceptible to manipulation and is too difficult to understand but as a useful and meaningful tool for making informative decisions for the benefit of society.</p><blockquote><p class=""><strong>Let’s be smart about Covid-19</strong></p></blockquote><p class="">The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic" target="_blank">last pandemic</a>&nbsp;(H1N1 in 2009) lasted about 20 months and killed about 0.5M people. The current pandemic (Covid-19 in 2019) will last X months and kill Y people.</p><p class="">There are several non-biological factors that make the Covid-19 pandemic different from all previous ones and we should think carefully what role these can play in its effectiveness and how they should be integrated into mathematical models and utilized in our interventions to tackle the virus.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile telephony global positioning system (GPS) data and location services data from social media could be used to monitor and inform outbreak control in real-time.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remote work, telemedicine, e-learning, online (food) shopping and social media can facilitate for social distancing while not drastically impacting work, schools, hospitals, food, and friendships.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our arsenal of Artificial Intelligence models will now be challenged to predict further outbreaks, identify best practices and potential weaknesses in our critical infrastructure, and even accelerate our search for a vaccine.</p><blockquote><p class=""><strong>In summary</strong></p></blockquote><p class="">While governments have ramped up efforts to improve readiness and invested heavily in R&amp;D, Covid-19 has taken us by surprise and demonstrated that we can never be too prepared. In addition to cautionary prevention measures, quantitative scientific methods do exist and should be engaged by policymakers to create tailored responses that can contain and mitigate the outbreak. Each country/region has its own characteristics and should not blindly copy/paste generic blanket solutions.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class=""><span><strong>References and useful articles</strong></span></p><p class="">Kucharski, Adam J., et al.&nbsp;<em>"</em><strong><em>Early dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study</em></strong><em>."</em>&nbsp;medRxiv (2020).</p><p class="">Cowling, Benjamin J., and Gabriel M.

Combined, these two are transforming the job market with increasing pace and agility. For example, Industry 4.0, a term used to refer to this digital transformation, leverages technologies like the internet of things (IoT) and automation to create “Smart factories” that will transform almost all aspects of our lives.</p><p class="">This rapid paradigm shift has sent shock waves to both the job market, employees and employers, politicians and educators around the world and calls for an action plan to train ourselves, our employees, and our children to adapt to unpredictable situations and to be more creative. Instead of focusing on careers, our life-long education strategy will thus need to focus on projects that train us on how to use and interact with available resources and in particular robots and AI. This will aid us to achieve our own individual, professional goals while also adding value to businesses ranging from lean start-ups to technology giants who seek to innovate.</p><p class="">As a team leader at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ultrahaptics.com/products-programs/academic-program/" target="_blank">Ultrahaptics</a>, and as an active researcher at the University of Cyprus and mentor to several students, I'm often asked what advice I'd give to recent graduates and PhD students in light of the current technological, climatic, and political uncertainties.</p><p class="">What should a recent graduate or young research professional facing all these do in order to ensure she survives and sees a good return in her educational and professional development investments?</p><p class="">The above question is nothing new. It has been addressed many times over the years and advice often comes from our educators, our peers, or our parents. While all of us mean good, the truth is that nobody really knows and we can only make educated guesses based on personal experience.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class="">Can we do better than that?</p></blockquote><p class="">According to the World-economic forum, for students to thrive in the emerging Industry 4.0 marketplace, they must learn to combine traditional skills (taught in classrooms) with skills in critical thinking (or problem solving), creativity (or design thinking), collaboration, emotional intelligence and cognitive flexibility (the ability to innovate). This has led to the recently embraced educational competencies also known as the “Four C's” (Creativity, Critical Thinking, Communication and Collaboration) that have long been hailed as the core skills to equip oneself when facing 21st-century challenges.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Creativity and Critical Thinking represent the fundamental ingredients for innovation. Similarly, Communication and Collaboration are critical life skills that underpin our ability to live, connect and work with one other. The “Four C's” strengthen our ability to find our place – professionally, personally, and socially – while fostering other life-enhancing C's: curiosity, confidence, caring and cooperation.</p><p class="">My advice is this, cultivate a good balance of C’s in your own life and in your organisation, and with a bit of motivation and strategic planning, you will find yourself heralding a breeding ground for inspirational ideas and innovation.</p><p class="">Innovations do not start from a desire to try something for the sake of being innovative. It is my thesis that innovations arise from the moment one realises that there is a problem and suspects that a new technology, method or system may provide an opportunity to do something better, or differently, and then trying it out. It’s a trial and error (“prototyping”) process, during which mistakes occur and students, professionals, and executives sometimes get confused and upset - you cannot expect them to get it from the word go. But with refinement and perseverance, and often some luck, some of these ideas work out well, gain support and momentum, and a useful new technique, system, or idea emerges. These ideas, which for the sake of this article I’m calling innovations, are what future employers will most likely be looking for from their workforce.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><br></p>]]></description><media:content type="image/png" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c6fd1c7c2ff616d47ed3809/1558943266314-XTEZ8U80E7RM3SG6HCAB/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOwgwK2q-V5u4gF4J3Jz3OcUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcEj1kdxkTT6_W9wuErq5I-c7t3HF_p8_FnhU2VYoX8YmSXJX0zxmNDL6mTz1mjMCJ/chair.png?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1280" height="661"><media:title type="plain">Cultivating Innovation and Creativity</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>My Creative Process</title><dc:creator>Orestis Georgiou</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2019 22:06:12 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.orestisgeorgiou.com/blog-feed/2019/4/4/my-creative-process</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c6fd1c7c2ff616d47ed3809:5c995f6d24a6947fcf5704d0:5ca67eb074e0e50001abaaaf</guid><description><![CDATA[&nbsp;<p>Basing my arguments on physical rationality, I’m always trying to pursue ideals of simplifying complexity that integrate novel hardware and data processes in ways that improve humans’ interactions with themselves and their environment. While keeping up to-date with academic journals and tech-news around the world is foundational to my creative process, what really allows me to apply my imagination and generate good ideas requires some further care and attentiveness. For example, I try to be positive, mindful and take notice of any quiet signals in my brain, or “weak activations” as they are called, for new insights or ideas worth pursuing further.</p>

<p>After identifying something that has potential originality and meaningfulness, I usually first must go and talk to people. I talk to people in my team, or people who I trust, and try to question my hypothesis over a cup of coffee or tea. I listen and entertain related ideas and alternatives and try to identify bigger problems or see the bigger picture. The first step is therefore quite distributed. A collaborative process of communal sense making and thought stirring. The next step in my creative process usually involves scribbling down some notes, thoughts and sketches on the back of the many unused printouts that tend to pile-up at the side of my desk. These are notes and papers that I will later recycle. At this stage in the process, I like the fact that I’m working on scrap paper as it gives me that extra freedom for unstructured, unbounded and unregretful exploration – I hate wasting paper. I then sleep on it in order to facilitate insightful reasoning or boost creative functions through dreams.</p>

Here, I chose my words judiciously such that they are both accurate in describing the purpose, function, and reasoning of my invention, but also, I chose my words such that they instil an expansive character to my text, thus encouraging the reader to pause and think of the implications and potential impact of what is being proposed.</p>&nbsp;]]></description></item><item><title>Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a single day</title><dc:creator>Orestis Georgiou</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2019 09:31:55 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.orestisgeorgiou.com/blog-feed/choose-a-job-you-love-and-you-will-never-have-to-work-a-single-day-blog-dr-orestis-georgiou</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c6fd1c7c2ff616d47ed3809:5c995f6d24a6947fcf5704d0:5c9a56cd7817f7986a4cfebc</guid><description><![CDATA[&nbsp;<p>Well, by that standard I don't think that anyone at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ultrahaptics.com/" target="_blank">Ultrahaptics</a>&nbsp;feels like they are working. There are many things I love about my job and in the next few lines I'll try to pen down my viewpoint that explains why working for Ultrahaptics doesn't feel like work.</p><p>I guess this blog is also quite timely since there are currently a few openings if you or someone you know is looking to join our exciting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ultrahaptics.com/careers/" target="_blank">journey</a>.</p><p>And it truly feels like an epic journey. Five months after I first joined UH in 2017, a group of us were out in one of Bristol's many local pubs showing our American colleagues (Ultrahaptics&nbsp;has an office in Bristol and in Palo Alto) a good time and trying some of the local beers. The night was full of work related discussions about what we wanted to do and how we were going to do it. We'd collaborate with X and develop with Y and demo at Z. It was going to be great! Never had I felt such team motivation and passion before. At some point,&nbsp;one of them&nbsp;raised his glass and said to me "let's change the world" (he probably doesn't remember saying this, but I do). Note that there was no senior management present and we had had a couple of pints already. Nevertheless, coming from an academic background where research publications on average receive 10-50 reads/citations, I found&nbsp;his&nbsp;words extremely impactful and refreshing. A year later and the journey continues and is as exciting as ever.</p>

<p>Ultrahaptics&nbsp;has developed a technology that enables you to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ultrahaptics.com/news/partners-stories/spatiotemporal-modulation/" target="_blank">feel virtual objects without touching them</a>&nbsp;- no wearables or hand-held controllers needed. Sounds like magic doesn't it? Here's a simplified explanation of how this magic works:&nbsp;we write code that is interpreted by our patented algorithms that instruct a set of complex electronic components to drive 100s of ultrasonic speakers at particular amplitudes and phases. The ultrasonic waves interfere constructively such that several high pressure points are created in the air above. When touched by a human these pressure points cause small vibrations onto the skin that can be sensed by a collection of tiny sensors embedded under our skin called mechanoreceptors. These mechanoreceptors are connected with nerves that transport the received vibration signals through our somatosensory system to the brain where they are decoded and translated into a tactile perception or haptic feedback. Depending on the initial code input, we can therefore create different tactile perceptions, e.g., the perception of fingertip grasping of a virtual object, or a button click, or a rotating dial, or a lightning spark or fire bolt... the list of tactile perceptions extends from physical to metaphysical and goes on and&nbsp;on&nbsp;since it's virtually fully software programmable.</p>&nbsp;

&nbsp;<p>My point is that magic is not easy. Everyday at the office, we have electronics engineers, mechanical engineers, acoustic engineers, software developers, haptics engineers, computer scientists, UX/UI designers, graphic designers, and even physicists and neuroscientists working together to improve and refine this magical experience of contactless haptic feedback. Never before have I been surrounded by such a talented, diverse, multi-skilled and multi-disciplinary group of individuals. We work in teams and sub teams and have frequent cross-team coordination meetings to ensure coherence, knowledge transfer, and that we're progressing according to our roadmaps. We also have internal seminars and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ultrahaptics.com/products-programs/academic-program/" target="_blank">collaborate with over 50 universities</a>&nbsp;worldwide.&nbsp;</p><p>And then there's Management, who I probably shouldn't be commenting about in a public post. Bottom line is that they have a clear plan that is well communicated to the rest of us in Engineering and Biz Dev and also ensure that we have all the tools and resources needed to execute that plan (and give us lot's of coffee and cake). They're also open and approachable: they have an "ask us anything" and "no blame" kind of attitude.</p><p>To summarise and to&nbsp;conclude: great culture, lots of talent, and a clear plan. These are in my view the three main ingredients for Ultrahaptics success and why I love my job.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><p><strong>Are you looking to join a workforce that challenges you?

<p>Let’s start with the journal of choice. The paper was published in the&nbsp;<a href="https://tog.acm.org/" target="_blank">ACM Transactions on Graphics</a>&nbsp;which to me initially came as a surprise but later accepted based on the following argument: We usually think of graphics as computer-generated 2D/3D still or animated images and therefore is quite disconnected from the field of haptics and the sense of touch. For a blind person however, graphics are haptics. The connection therefore does exist and so one simply needs to think of ultrasonic haptics as computer generated 2D/3D still or animated images that are sensed by the skin rather than the eyes.</p><p>In visual graphics, the blending of RGB colours, the contrast and dynamic range, the method for rendering of polygonal meshes, the resolution and the animation frame rate are some of the fundamentals related to the image quality. Similar fundamentals exist in analogy to Ultrahaptics graphics, most of which were first studied in this seminal 2014 paper:<br></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Novel algorithms were introduced that animate 2D geometrical shapes such that as a result 3D objects are felt.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Efficient algorithms were discussed that unlocked the possibility of rendering multiple focus points in real time and at predictable frame-rates.</p></li><li><p>Optimisation algorithms were introduced that can boost hardware performance as to achieve increased strength of the mid-air tactile sensations.</p></li><li><p>Simulation software was used to visualise the results, and user studies were conducted to verify them.</p></li><li><p>New hardware architectures were designed and built to implement the above algorithms.</p></li></ul><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><p>All these investigations and many more continue to occur at Ultrahaptics today, where we try to uncover and exploit the various trade-offs between quality, performance, and costs whilst remaining within the realms of physics and perception. Moreover, we strongly subscribe to the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_innovation" target="_blank">open innovation</a>&nbsp;model and collaborate with multiple Universities and Research Labs in order to facilitate knowledge transfer and accelerate innovation in haptics, HCI, and focused ultrasound.</p><p>text</p>

<p>Maybe it’s my own wishful thinking, but I have the strong impression that this year we’ve seen a number of technologies demonstrate what MIT calls "staying power". Reinforcement learning in AI, Quantum Computing, Autonomous Vehicles, Robotics, and Virtual Reality are some of my favourites. These will undoubtedly affect our economy, our politics, improve our lives, and influence our cultures. Some are already unfolding before us whilst others will take longer to develop and proliferate.</p><p>Virtual Reality (VR), for instance, is well established in the gaming industry and has already made several inroads into many other sectors. Importantly however, with recent backing from several of the current tech giants, VR has finally gone mainstream and is now reaching more people than ever before.</p><p>One of the many reasons for this extraordinary growth is the recent advancements in Haptic technologies. To date, VR has been predominantly audio-visual through a head-mounted-display and a pair of headphones. That’s only two out of our five senses.</p><h3><em>That’s just 40%</em></h3><p>Yes, this is a very crude estimate, and yes, the tantalizing potential in systems that leverage tactile cues in VR has been the subject of research since the mid-80s. However, only recently have we seen commercially available haptic apparatus that supports advanced interactions in VR and enables for easy software development of quality content that can actually deliver.</p>

<p>Haptics is the science of applying touch sensations to control and interact with computer applications. Haptic technologies is a market currently estimated at $16 billion and expected to reach $ 44.5 billion by 2022. Indeed, the potential for using haptics in interfaces for virtual-environment and tele-operator applications is enormous, and appears to be growing exponentially. To be highly effective however, haptic researchers need to consider not only the hardware and software, but also the human user. This is why there are continuing challenges related to making the technology more seamless, reliable, and natural.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h2>Biblical Haptics</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, one of the oldest published uses of the word “haptics” (from the Greek ἅπτω) comes from the Bible. Note that there is no religious connection intended here, but rather an interesting appearance of metaphysical haptics in an ancient scholarly published text. In John 20:17 (what a coincidence!), the verse containing Jesus' response to Mary Magdalene right after his resurrection says: “μή μου&nbsp;<strong>ἅπτου</strong>, οὔπω γὰρ ἀναβέβηκα πρὸς τὸν πατέρα” (Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father). Many years later, and the word “haptics” is back on our publication radar. In fact, Google’s&nbsp;<a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams" target="_blank">Ngram&nbsp;</a>Viewer (an online search engine that charts word frequencies in printed sources) shows how “haptics” has closely followed “touch screen” until 2008.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Experience Age</h2><p>Whilst Ngram doesn’t report on what has happened over the last 9 years, it’s not difficult to imagine the steep upward trends, and extrapolate them even higher as we depart from the Information Age and enter the so-called&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/the-information-age-is-over-welcome-to-the-experience-age/" target="_blank">Experience Age</a>&nbsp;- an age defined by Snapchat videos and VR digital content, rather than Facebook status updates. In this exciting new Age, digital content exists not only in image, audio and video formats, but also in haptic formats. This is a result of many years of research and development by the ever-growing haptics community, supported of course by market forces, public funding, and our own career opportunities and aspirations.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Priority Research Areas</h2><p>We see nowadays an increasing number of conferences and journals where haptic researchers can publish their findings. According to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ieee-ras.org/haptics" target="_blank">IEEE Technical Committee on Haptics</a>, the successful deployment of haptic interfaces requires continuing advancements in hardware and software algorithms, as well as our understanding of the human somatosensory system. Furthermore, current priority areas include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;devices and technology, tactile display and tactile sensing, haptic rendering, perception and psychophysics, neuroscience, haptic cognition, multi-modal perception, sensory guided motor control, and haptic communication.&nbsp;See also the haptic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computer.org/web/toh/taxonomy" target="_blank">taxonomy</a>.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Applying and Developing Ideas</h2>

<p>The above research areas find a plethora of applications in, for example, Robotics, Medicine, Entertainment, Transport, Education, and the Arts, making the research field of haptics truly transdisciplinary. Moreover, many underlying market opportunities have been seized by entrepreneurs to form start-ups, many of which are now&nbsp;<a href="http://www.strategymrc.com/report/haptics-technology-market-2016" target="_blank">multi-million</a>&nbsp;dollar companies who are shaping the future. But, as we all know, it all starts with an idea, and ideas have needs.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8607581" target="_blank">Haptics Research Group</a>&nbsp;was formed to provide a space which facilitates conversations on haptics, where researchers can connect, share and shape ideas, funding and market opportunities.</p><h3>The haptics technology market is said to be growing at 22%. Be a part of it!</h3><p>I’d therefore invite you to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8607581" target="_blank">join&nbsp;</a>this group if you are interested to learn more about haptics, and post relevant discussion topics, question the status quo, post links to reports, articles, and presentation slides, and of course advertise job and funding opportunities. Feel free to sell your vision and brag about your new results. Please though engage with these posts both from an&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>&nbsp;perspective and give ideas the attention that they deserve. &nbsp;</p>&nbsp;

These marathon-like events are increasingly popular with keen students and future looking tech companies. The students get to meet like-minded people, get hands-on experience with the latest software or hardware gadgets, and eventually create some cool new technology. Companies get to quickly develop new software technologies, test their existing ones, cultivate culture, talent and interest, and locate new areas for innovation and funding.&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;

&nbsp;<p>Already, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ultrahaptics.com/products/academic-program/?utm_source=LinkedIn&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=studenthack-hackathon_May" target="_blank">Ultrahaptics Academic Program</a>&nbsp;has attended its first&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ultrahaptics.com/studenthack-v-winners/?utm_source=LinkedIn&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=studenthack-hackathon_May" target="_blank">hackathon</a>&nbsp;in March 2017. I’m very excited to say that we got to mentor four outstanding teams, two of which were awarded winning prizes out of the 400 participants in total.&nbsp;<em>A-MAZE-BALL</em>&nbsp;got the overall “<span>best-hack</span>” award, and&nbsp;<em>Bongo Hero</em>&nbsp;got the “<span>best VR hack</span>” award. In fact, we were so impressed by Bongo Hero, that we will be inviting the winning team to intern at Ultrahaptics this summer where they will perfect their prototype and get to experience first-hand what it’s like to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ultrahaptics.com/careers/?utm_source=LinkedIn&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=studenthack-hackathon_May" target="_blank">work at Ultrahaptics</a>&nbsp;and therefore positively influence their future career paths.</p><p>If a group of undergraduate students are able to realise such cool prototypes in 36 hours, can you imagine what a team of experienced engineers can put together? To that end, I’m super excited about the diversity in applications that Ultrahaptics finds use in and keen to see how far and wide the academic community can take our platform. Hackathons are great opportunities to kickstart such use cases and so I’d welcome any future invitations to participate and support.</p>

Our plan is to feature some of these projects on our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ultrahaptics.com/products/academic-program/" target="_blank">website</a>. This is a big step for us and will definitely accelerate innovation in this space by harnessing ideas from great minds and diverse collaborative teams.</p><p>Already, the Academic Program has been met with great interest from the scientific community with enquiries coming in from as far as New Zealand and Peru! Our goal is to enable researchers to explore new application areas and uses of Ultrahaptics technology. I therefore aim to work closely with universities to understand their research ideas and identify the right HW platform for their needs. All our kit ships with a library of pre-built haptic sensations, example code, a fully documented SDK and an API. This means that Academic Program members can kick-start research projects, develop new prototypes, evaluate, publish and demo their work.</p><p>The feedback I get from our academic partners also provides us with insights into the demand and technical challenges that our Engineering team needs to tackle in future product iterations. Hence, the Academic Program is a bi-directional innovation link connecting Ultrahaptics with universities, and universities with Ultrahaptics. I’m really excited to be at this “playmaker” position and keen to help launch all sorts of interesting research projects.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><p>Visit the Ultrahaptics&nbsp;website&nbsp;to check out our existing academic portfolio.</p>
